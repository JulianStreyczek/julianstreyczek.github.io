In 2021, the total amount of data created was estimated to have reached 79 zettabyte,<d-footnote>1 zettabyte = 10^12 gigabyte</d-footnote> up from 2 zettabyte in 2010.<d-footnote>https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created, last accessed Dec 18 2021.</d-footnote> Also in economic research, available data are now often high-dimensional, for example when using administrative records, scanner data, or text data. For data of that size, the econometrician’s usual inference toolkit revolving around least squares regression is often infeasible.</p> <p>It is evident that as the nature of data evolve, the empirical science analyzing these data must evolve as well. The field of statistics has been embracing this change for some time now, a process that was famously promoted by Breiman (2001)<d-cite key="breiman2001statistical"></d-cite>. In this pioneering article, Breiman advertises what are now commonly known as machine learning methods: flexible statistical tools that analyze data while imposing little structure on them. The field of economics, however, has been slow to adapt to the new status quo, and despite their tremendous success in many applications, major advances in machine learning have found their way into standard economics and econometrics only very recently.</p> <p>One issue that lies at the heart of econometrics is estimation of causal effects. Formally, given data on some outcome, treatment, and covariates, \(\{(Y_i, W_i, X_i)\}_{i=1,...,N}\), one is interested in estimating the average treatment effect \(\tau = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)]\), where \(Y_i(w)\) denotes the potential outcome that unit \(i\) would have if it would be assigned treatment \(w\). In practice, treatment effects can differ considerably between units, so that the aim is often recovery of <em>heterogeneous</em> treatment effects given covariates, \(\tau(x)=\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)\vert X_i=x]\). For example, one might want to estimate the individual-specific effect of a costly policy, to apply it only to individuals who derive sufficient benefit from it.</p> <p>There are two problems that may render estimation via least squares infeasible. First, in high-dimensional data the number of covariates can easily exceed the number of observations. Second, the heterogeneous treatment effect \(\tau(x)\) may exhibit severe non-monotonicity and involve complex interactions between covariates. Then, even if the number of covariates is only moderately high, estimating the shape of \(\tau(x)\) may require more parameters in the least squares regression than can be estimated precisely.</p> <p>Where classic least squares methods capitulate before this new type of data, machine learning methods are up to the task. One particular method that has proven itself to scale well with large and complex data is called <em>random forest</em>. In brief, a random forest generates a large number of <em>regression trees</em>, which each approximate a given high-dimensional relationship by a step-function. By randomly varying input data when constructing these trees, the random forest generates many different models and finally averages their predictions.</p> <p>Unfortunately, although random forests are a powerful tool for analyzing high-dimensional data, they cannot be used out-of-the-box for problems in economic research, for two reasons. First, the trees that make up the random forest are prediction methods; they approximate a given function by balancing the fundamental trade-off between bias and variance of the prediction. Instead, economists require causal methods; unbiased estimates are strictly necessary, at the deliberate expense of higher variance. This point will be explained in more detail later. Second, random forests are like many machine learning methods essentially model-free; they impose little prior structure on the final prediction. In contrast, economics models are often informed by economic theory, and it is not straightforward how to incorporate it when constructing trees.</p> <p><em>Causal forests</em> are a groundbreaking method that allows inferring heterogeneous treatment effects using random forests. In doing so, they bridge the gap between machine learning and standard econometrics, allowing detailed causal inference from large data.</p> <p>This article proceeds as follows. The next section summarizes the core concepts behind regression trees and random forests. The third section explains the conceptual steps to adapt random forests for the estimation of causal effects, and introduces the “state of the art” for estimating causal forests. The final section showcases an application, and discusses limitations and alternatives.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="a-quick-summary-of-random-forests">A Quick Summary of Random Forests</h2> <p>A classic version of a tree is the <em>classification and regression tree</em> (CART) as proposed by Breiman et al. (1984)<d-cite key="breiman1984cart"></d-cite>. Given data on some outcome and associated covariates \(\{(Y_i, X_i)\}_{i=1,...,N}\in \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^K\) for possibly large \(K\in\mathbb{N}\), a regression tree approximates the relationship between \(Y_i\) and \(X_i\) by a step function. It does so by partitioning the covariate space into a set of rectangles \(\{R_1,...,R_M\}\), where the prediction of \(Y_m\) for rectangle \(m\) is the average of all observations falling into the rectangle, \(\hat Y_m = \text{avg}(\{X_i: i\in R_m\})\). The case of two covariates is illustrated in the figure below.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2022-01-01-causal-forests-guide/CARTvisualization-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2022-01-01-causal-forests-guide/CARTvisualization-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2022-01-01-causal-forests-guide/CARTvisualization-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2022-01-01-causal-forests-guide/CARTvisualization.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Exemplary visualization of a regression tree with K=2 covariates. Source: James et al. (2013)<d-cite key="james2013introduction"></d-cite>. </div> <p>The partition is generated as follows: The initial <em>node</em> is simply the complete covariate space. Then, this node is repeatedly split in two to minimize prediction mean squared error (MSE) <em>greedily</em>; that is, each split looks for the maximum <em>immediate</em> improvement in MSE. A split must occur in one dimension only: Given some node \(R\), a split is characterized by a covariate \(x_k\) and a corresponding value \(c\). Then, the <em>child node</em> \(R_1\) contains the subset of \(R\) with \(x_k\leq c\), and the child node \(R_2\) contains its complement; the subset of \(R\) with \(x_k&gt;c\). In this fashion, nodes are repeatedly split until a certain stopping criterion is reached, for example until all terminal nodes (“<em>leafs</em>”) contain a pre-specified minimum number of observations.</p> <p>The procedure is prone to overfitting: With each new split, the tree predicts better the training data, which reduces bias but increases variance of the predictions. To balance this inherent trade-off, one needs to select one tree from the sequence of trees obtained from adding splits. A method for doing so is <em>cost complexity pruning</em>, which introduces a penalty parameter \(\alpha\) on the number of nodes \(T\) that combined with the MSE generates a score \(C_\alpha\) for each tree:</p> \[C_{\alpha} = MSE + \alpha |T| \ .\] <p>By finding \(\alpha\) through cross-validation, one determines the optimal depth of the tree.</p> <p>The major advantages of CARTs are their interpretability (the partition makes it transparent how predictions are made), and their computational speed even with high-dimensional data. However, the major disadvantage is that although CARTs often have low bias, they tend to have relatively high variance, so that predictions may change drastically with small changes to the input data. For that reason, Breiman (1996)<d-cite key="breiman1996bagging"></d-cite> proposes <em>bagging</em> (“<strong>b</strong>ootstrap <strong>agg</strong>regat<strong>ing</strong>”): averaging the predictions of multiple trees, each grown on a subsample of the data. Notably, this procedure works well exactly because of the high variance among trees, since the final prediction is obtained from comparing very different models. To that end, the performance of this <em>random forest</em> can often be improved by further decorrelating trees, for example by considering only a random subset of covariates at each split.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="from-causal-trees-to-causal-forests">From Causal Trees to Causal Forests</h2> <p>We now turn back to our initial problem of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects. Suppose we are given a sample of outcome, treatment, and covariates, \(\{(Y_i, W_i, X_i)\}_{i=1,...,N}\), and assume that treatment is randomized conditional on covariates</p> \[Y_i(1), Y_i(0) \perp W_i\ | X_i \ ,\] <p>which is typically referred to as unconfoundedness, a necessary condition for identification. We are interested in estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) for some point \(x\):</p> \[\tau(x)=\mathbb{E}[\tau_i(x)|X_i=x] \qquad\text{where}\qquad \tau_i = Y_i(1)-Y_i(0) .\] <p>There are two main reasons why a random forest consisting of the usual CARTs is not suited for this estimation problem. First, CARTs split and prune to maximize prediction MSE \(\sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i-\hat\mu(X_i))^2/N\), so that the most natural adaptation to our problem would entail targeting estimation MSE \(\sum_{i=1}^N (\tau_i - \hat\tau_i(X_i))^2/N\). However, \(\tau_i\) is never actually observed, rendering this option infeasible. The second reason is that naive splitting will bias estimates, which is a more subtle point. To see why, consider a simple example where the covariate space contains only two elements, \(\mathbb{X}=\{L,R\}\), and we wish to estimate the difference in outcomes \(\Delta=\mathbb{E}[Y_L-Y_R]\). If we try to estimate \(\Delta\) via a tree, we have two choices: Either split the initial node, or not, which results in estimates \(\hat\Delta=0\) or \(\hat\Delta=\overline{Y}_L-\overline{Y}_R\), where \(\overline{Y}_\ell\) defines the average outcome in leaf \(\ell\in\{L,R\}\). The most natural splitting rule places a split if and only if \(\overline{Y}_L-\overline{Y}_R&gt;c\) for some \(c\in\mathbb{R}\). However, this procedure introduces selection bias: For example, if due to sampling variability we observe \(\overline{Y}_L-\overline{Y}_R&gt;c\), our estimate is biased upwards: \(\hat\Delta=\mathbb{E}[Y_L-Y_R\vert\overline{Y}_L-\overline{Y}_R&gt;c]&gt;\Delta\).</p> <h3 id="causal-trees">Causal Trees</h3> <p>Athey and Imbens (2016)<d-cite key="athey2016recursive"></d-cite> modify the CART procedure to generate what they call <em>causal trees</em>. These trees differ from CARTs in two ways: First, causal trees use different sets of observations for building the tree and estimating treatment effects - which the authors call an <em>honest</em> approach to estimation - instead of conducting both steps on the same data. Second, causal trees use an adapted rule for splitting and pruning that targets treatment effect heterogeneity instead of prediction MSE.</p> <p><strong>Honest approach.</strong> Honest estimation solves the problem of selection. Employing the simplified example above, even if due to sampling variability we happen to observe \(\overline{Y}_L-\overline{Y}_R&gt;c\) and place a split, the final estimate \(\hat\Delta\) will be computed with an independent sample, and thus be unbiased. However, it should be noted that this procedure entails a trade-off: By splitting observations into a <em>training</em> sample for partitioning and an <em>estimation</em> sample for calculating effects, both steps will be conducted using less observations. Therefore, the honest approach makes a sacrifice in variance for improvements in bias.</p> <p>Moreover, note that honest estimation modifies the rules for splitting and cross-validation. To illustrate this fact, consider the splitting target of a CART, which for a given training sample \(S^{tr}\) and partition \(\Pi\) can be written<d-footnote>In the following, division by the number of observations is ignored for better readability.</d-footnote></p> \[MSE_\mu(S^{tr}, S^{tr}, \Pi) = \sum_{i\in S^{tr}} (Y_i-\hat\mu(X_i;S^{tr},\Pi))^2 \ .\] <p>In the honest approach, the equivalent would be</p> \[MSE_\mu(S^{tr}, S^{est}, \Pi) = \sum_{i\in S^{tr}} (Y_i-\hat\mu(X_i;S^{est},\Pi))^2 \ .\] <p>However, since the point is not to use the estimation sample \(S^{est}\) for partitioning, the data in \(S^{est}\) are treated as a random variable during the tree-building phase. Therefore, the target is expected MSE</p> \[EMSE_\mu(S^{tr}, S^{est}, \Pi) = \mathbb{E}_{S^{est}} [MSE_\mu(S^{tr}, S^{est}, \Pi)] \ .\] <p>Splits are placed to improve an approximation \(\widehat{EMSE}_\mu(\cdot)\), and similarly for cross-validation.</p> <p><strong>Targeting treatment effect heterogeneity.</strong> Recall that splitting and cross-validation also need to be adapted for estimating (unobserved) treatment effects as opposed to (observed) goodness of fit. The key insight here is that for minimizing the MSE of the treatment effect \(MSE_\tau = \sum_i (\tau_i - \hat\tau_i(X_i))^2\), it is sufficient to maximize the variance of of \(\hat\tau(X_i)\) in each child node. For an illustration, consider again the conventional (non-honest) CART target</p> \[MSE_\mu = \sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}} (Y_i-\hat\mu(X_i))^2 = \sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}} Y_i^2 - \sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}} \hat\mu(X_i)^2 \ .\] <p>Since \(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}} Y_i^2\) is unaffected by splitting decisions, \(MSE_\mu\) can be minimized by maximizing \(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}} \hat\mu(X_i)^2\), which is equivalent to maximizing \(Var(\hat\mu(X_i))=\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}} \hat\mu(X_i)^2 - \big(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}} \hat\mu(X_i)\big)^2\) since \(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}} \hat\mu(X_i) = \sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}} Y_i\) for all trees. In other words, we can minimize the MSE of \(\hat\mu(\cdot)\) by picking splits that maximize the variance of \(\hat\mu(\cdot)\). Analogously, causal trees maximize a variance estimate of \(\hat\tau(X_i)\) at each split. Intuitively, targeting high treatment effect variance will lead to large heterogeneity in treatment effects across nodes, which is exactly the goal.</p> <p>As before, this splitting rule needs to be adapted to the honest approach, which entails estimating a target \(\widehat{EMSE}_\tau(\cdot)\), and similarly for cross-validation.</p> <h3 id="causal-forests">Causal Forests</h3> <p>Although causal trees allow inferring consistent estimates for conditional average treatment effects, they are not ideal for practical applications. First, just like common CARTs, causal trees can be sensitive to small changes in inputs, and therefore in general have high variance. Second, they tend to generate relatively large leaves, in which the assumption of unconfoundedness is unlikely to hold: Usually, observations in a large leaf will differ in their probability of receiving treatment, so that naive treatment effect estimates will be biased. Third, no asymptotic theory is available for estimates obtained from causal trees, which might make it difficult to justify their application in economics papers.</p> <p>Wager and Athey (2018)<d-cite key="wager2018estimation"></d-cite> propose causal forests, which address these problems. Causal forests are a natural extension of causal trees in the spirit of Breiman (1996)<d-cite key="breiman1996bagging"></d-cite>’s bagging approach that reduces the variance of estimates. Specifically, instead of growing and pruning a single causal tree, Wager and Athey (2018)<d-cite key="wager2018estimation"></d-cite> propose growing many deep causal trees on subsamples of the data. Notably, these trees will not be pruned at all, but are instead grown until certain stopping criteria are reached. These deep trees have small leaves, so that observations in each leaf can be assumed homogeneous, implying that the unconfoundedness assumption likely holds.</p> <p>As in Breiman (1996)<d-cite key="breiman1996bagging"></d-cite>, averaging estimates from different trees becomes more powerful the more different the trees are; that is, the higher the variance between them. Therefore, it has proven effective to introduce variability additionally to random subsampling by considering only a subset of variables for splitting at each split. This has the added benefit that in expectation, leafs are small enough in every dimension of the covariate space. Moreover, the authors recommend balanced splitting, in which only splits are allowed that leave a minimum number of treated and untreated observations in each child node, and which do not generate child nodes of very different size.</p> <h3 id="state-of-the-art-causal-forests">State-of-the-Art Causal Forests</h3> <p>In practice, the inventors prefer a slightly different implementation of causal forests that is applicable to a wider range of estimation problems and promises better performance.</p> <p>The main problem with causal forests as in Wager and Athey (2018)<d-cite key="wager2018estimation"></d-cite> is that they tackle only the specific problem of treatment effect estimation. Instead, the <em>generalized random forest</em> as introduced in Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager (2019)<d-cite key="athey2019generalized"></d-cite> can estimate any parameter that can be formulated as the solution to a moment equation. This includes the specific estimation problem of heterogeneous treatment effects, but also allows estimation when treatment assignment is endogenous and therefore needs to be instrumented. For example, when trying to assess the effect of childbirth on mothers’ labor choices, there may be issues of reverse causality (labor choices affecting procreation decisions) or omitted variable bias (personality characteristics affecting both labor choice and procreation decisions). More generally, generalized random forests allow estimating many of the workhorse models in economics such as least squares, instrumental variables, maximum likelihood, and quantile regression.</p> <p>When estimating a causal forest within the generalized random forests framework, the implementation bears three main differences to the outline above: First, the causal forest is now only used to infer observation weights that are then used for estimating a <em>local moment condition</em>. Second, the splitting criterion is approximated by a linear function. Third, the authors recommend regressing out the effect of covariates before estimation, which is referred to as <em>orthogonalization</em>.</p> <p><strong>Local moment condition.</strong> Consider any estimation problem whose solution \(\theta(x)\) solves some moment condition</p> \[E[\psi_\theta|X_i=x]=0 \ .\] <p>Then, taking inspiration from similar approaches in nonparametric regression, it is straightforward to estimate \(\theta(x)\) using the <em>locally-weighted</em> sample analog</p> \[\hat\theta(x) = \arg \min_\theta \Big\|\sum \alpha_i(x) \psi_\theta\Big\|_2 \ ,\] <p>where \(\alpha_i(x)\) are weights indicating the “closeness” of observation \(i\) to some test point \(x\). These weights will be estimated via a causal forest.</p> <p>To clarify the above point: In a classical random forest, each tree computes its own treatment effect estimate for the test point \(x\), and the final estimate is the average of these individual estimates. In a generalized random forest, one does not use the estimates of the trees, but only the partitions they generate. Intuitively, if an observation is in the same leaf as \(x\) in many trees of the forest, it can be interpreted as being very similar, and therefore important for estimating any quantity of interest at \(x\). Moreover, being in the same leaf is more important if the considered leaf is small, since that observation “survived” many splits together with \(x\). Conversely, an observation that is not “close” to \(x\) in many trees is likely less important for estimating \(\theta(x)\).</p> <p>The idea of inferring local weighting from a random forest is illustrated in the figure below. Formally, when growing a total of \(B\) trees, we can define as \(\alpha_{bi}\) the importance of observation \(i\) in tree \(b\), and as \(\alpha_i(x)\) the overall weight of \(i\) for \(x\):</p> \[\alpha_{bi}(x) = \frac{\mathbf{1}(\text{$i$ is in same leaf as $x$})}{\text{no. observations in same leaf as $x$}} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \alpha_i = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B \alpha_{bi}(x) \ .\] <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2022-01-01-causal-forests-guide/GRFweighting-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2022-01-01-causal-forests-guide/GRFweighting-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2022-01-01-causal-forests-guide/GRFweighting-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2022-01-01-causal-forests-guide/GRFweighting.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Exemplary visualization of the local weights inferred by a random forest.

Source: Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager (2019)<d-cite key="athey2019generalized"></d-cite>. </div> <p><strong>Splitting.</strong> As before, trees are built by greedy splitting to maximize heterogeneity in treatment effects. Although the estimation problem is framed differently, the final target is still minimizing the MSE of \(\theta(x)\) (the CATE, \(\tau(x)\), in our case). Therefore, the ideal splitting criterion would be exactly the same as in Athey and Imbens (2016)<d-cite key="athey2016recursive"></d-cite>. However, since in general \(\theta(x)\) is only identified through a moment condition (as opposed to a closed-form expression as for example the least squares estimator), the exact criterion from Athey and Imbens (2016)<d-cite key="athey2016recursive"></d-cite> is generally not feasible.</p> <p>Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager (2019)<d-cite key="athey2019generalized"></d-cite> propose a sufficient statistic for the exact criterion, which has the property that maximizing it also maximizes the exact criterion. However, since this statistic would be computationally demanding to compute exactly, they use a linear approximation of it. Without going into the details, splitting then reduces to two steps: a <em>labelling</em> and a <em>regression</em> step. The labelling step computes <em>pseudo-outcomes</em> that estimate how much each observation increases or decreases the objective function. These pseudo-outcomes form the splitting criterion that can be targeted as in the classical CART algorithm. Importantly, the authors show that this procedure nests the splitting procedure of classic CARTs, which is why generalized random forests are a proper generalization of random forests as introduced by Breiman (1996)<d-cite key="breiman1996bagging"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>Orthogonalization.</strong> The authors stress that performance of a causal forest can be improved by first regressing out the effects of the covariates on outcomes and treatment, which makes it more likely that the unconfoundedness assumption holds. This procedure is similar to the idea of <em>double machine learning</em> as proposed by Chernozhukov et al. (2018a)<d-cite key="chernozhukov2018double"></d-cite>. Specifically, one starts by inferring the conditional marginal expectation functions on the outcome, \(m(x) = E[Y_i\vert X_i=x]\), and on the treatment, \(e(x) = E[W_i\vert X_i=x]\). These are two standard prediction problems that can be tackled by standard machine learning algorithms (hence the name double machine learning) such as classical random forests. Next, one runs the causal forest using as data the residuals of the outcome, \(\tilde Y_i = Y_i - m(x)\), and the treatment \(\tilde W_i = W_i - e(x)\).</p> <p>Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager (2019)<d-cite key="athey2019generalized"></d-cite> show that generalized random forests have favorable asymptotic properties, building on previous results from Wager and Athey (2018)<d-cite key="wager2018estimation"></d-cite>. Under certain regularity conditions, \(\hat\tau(x)\) is consistent and asymptotically normal, and the asymptotic variance of \(\hat\tau(x)\) can be accurately estimated. These theoretical results verify that causal forests can be used for rigorous statistical inference with standard asymptotic properties, which makes the method attractive for the classical estimation problems in economics.</p> <p>The table below summarizes the core conceptual steps when estimating heterogeneous treatment effects at some test point \(x\) via a causal forest, as currently implemented in the R-package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grf</code>.</p> <div class="l-body"> <table style="table-layout: auto; width: 100%;"> <caption><strong>Table:</strong> Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects via causal forests</caption> <thead> <tr> <th style="width: 30%; white-space: nowrap;">Step</th> <th style="width: 70%;">Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="white-space: nowrap;">1. <strong>Orthogonalize</strong></td> <td>Obtain residuals $\tilde{Y}_i = Y_i - m(x)$ and $\tilde{W}_i = W_i - e(x)$ via classical random forests.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="white-space: nowrap;">2. <strong>Generate causal forest</strong></td> <td> For $b=1,...,B$: <ul style="margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.3;"> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Take a subsample from $\{\tilde{Y}_i, \tilde{W}_i\}_{i=1,...,N}$ of size $s&lt;N$</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Split the subsample into a training set $S^{tr}$ and an estimation set $S^{est}$</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Grow a causal tree using $S^{tr}$.

First and foremost, they are a powerful tool for uncovering heterogeneity in treatment effects, even with many covariates and under complex functional forms. Second, the generalized random forests framework allows tackling a wide range of empirical problems, including both binary and continuous treatment, and instruments. Moreover, the same framework can be used for other standard estimation problems in economics as well. Third, the estimation procedure is similar to the method of moments estimator commonly used in economics, and therefore arguably intuitive. Moreover, the weighting makes transparent which observations play a key role for the final estimates. Fourth, causal forests are easy to implement through the openly available and well-documented R-package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grf</code>. Finally, the approach has similar asymptotic properties as the workhorse models in economics, and is therefore well-justified.</p> <p>Despite their benefits, causal forests are not a one-size-fits-all solution. First, the estimates generally depend on many tuning parameters which may require careful calibration. For an economist, calibrating the model might be an unusual experience since the optimal parameter values cannot be inferred from economic theory, but rather from trial and error as well as experience. Automatic calibration via cross-validation is possible, but may require a large number of observations while at the same time it is usually difficult to judge what exactly “large enough” is. Second, the package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grf</code> is so far only available in R, which might require some researchers to spend time getting acquainted with the language. Finally, one should consider that not many researchers in economics are familiar with causal forests, and some might hold reservations against a method they do not understand. Thus, compared to standard methods in economics, one might need to put extra effort into convincing their audience that their findings are correct.</p> <p>As a last note, this article would be incomplete without mentioning <em>double machine learning</em> as introduced by Chernozhukov et al. (2018a)<d-cite key="chernozhukov2018double"></d-cite>, which is a very general estimation method for identifying average treatment effects from high-dimensional data. The key idea is what we called orthogonalization in the context of generalized random forests, where it was included because it proved favorable in other settings. Chernozhukov et al. (2018b)<d-cite key="chernozhukov2018generic"></d-cite> extend their procedure for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in randomized experiments. As such, causal forests and double machine learning are currently the most promising approaches for estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects.</p>]]></content><author><name>Julian Streyczek</name></author><category term="causal-forests"/><category term="machine-learning"/><category term="econometrics"/><category term="treatment-effects"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A guide to understanding and implementing causal forests for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, bridging the gap between machine learning and econometrics.]]></summary></entry></feed>
