Hello there! I am a fifth-year PhD student in Economics at 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/">Bocconi University</a>
in Milan, Italy. 

My research uses observational data and **applied econometric methods** to better understand how **digital media** affect the production and consumption of information, 
with special attention to **political effects** in developed democracies. 

If you would like to get in contact, please feel free to reach out!
