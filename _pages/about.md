Hello there! I\'m a PhD Candidate in Economics at 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/">Bocconi University</a>
in Milan, Italy. I spent January through May 2025 as a Visiting Fellow at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>.

My research uses observational data, **applied econometric methods**, and machine learning to better understand how **digital media** affect individual attitudes and behavior.

If you would like to get in contact, feel free to reach out!
